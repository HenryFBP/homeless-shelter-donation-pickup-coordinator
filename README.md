It will achieve this by letting donaters and shelters essentially cooperate with
each other over this platform.

# For donaters
- List what items they wish to donate
- Publish their location to homeless shelters as to optimize the collection
- routes of pickup vehicles
- See **which shelters**; **where**; need **what** items 
- Get notified of pickup routes
  - If a route does not intersect with you, is there another dropoff point
  nearby?
  
# For shelters

- See all people who have things to donate
- Plan routes based off of customizable criteria:
  - Distance
  - Needed items
