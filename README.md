# Homeless Shelter Donation Pickup Coordinator

This application will (once developed) help to coordinate picking up
to-be-donated goods from people who wish to donate them.

It will achieve this by letting donaters and shelters essentially cooperate with
each other over this platform.

# For donaters:
- List what items they wish to donate
- Publish their location to homeless shelters as to optimize the collection
- routes of pickup vehicles
- See **which shelters**; **where**; need **what** items 
- Get notified of pickup routes
  - If a route does not intersect with you, is there another dropoff point
  nearby?
  
# For shelters:
- Publicly display needed items
- See all people who have things to donate
- Plan routes based off of customizable criteria:
  - Distance
  - Needed items
  - Statistics! (possibly)
    - See item-yield of routes as statistics
    - Heatmap of item density?
  - By item group
    - Clothing
      - Winter clothes
      - Summer clothes
    - Food
      - Canned food
      - Produce
