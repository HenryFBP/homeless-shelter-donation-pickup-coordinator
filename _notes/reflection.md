  <blockquote>
    <p>
      For the second option, students have the option to conceive and/or create a
      digital media project (e.g. Blog, YouTube channel, a civic media app) that
      would contribute to the practice of a particular dimension of citizenship
      for certain groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project will apply ideas and concepts developed in class to a
      creative/interventionist tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students opting for the second project should discuss their ideas with the
      instructor and may be required to submit a short (3-5 page) reflection with
      with their media prototypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of their final project choice, each student will also give a
      10-minute presentation about their project on the final week of the
      semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presentation grade is part of your overall project/paper mark.

# Ideas
- My initial idea for this application
  - Extremely naive
  - Essentially, it would contain a database full of homeless people so that their needs could be tracked and when someone saw that a person near them needed something, they would be able to go and give/buy that person the thing they needed
  - Was made within the context of a world where everyone wanted to help oneanother
  - Problems:
    - What if a person doesn't want to be tracked?
    - Homeless people don't have phones
    - System could be abused to track people against their wishes
    
- How does an application enforce certain moral standards?
  - Wording within application can suggest a way of thinking, i.e.
    > "Charitable giving" or "help these poor people"

    versus
    
    > "Help us do the job that the government is failing to do"
    
- Why should we aid homeless people?
  - Pity? (feel bad for them)
  - Charity?
  - Enforcement of basic human rights?
  - To make ourselves feel good?
  
- Why SHOULDN'T we help homeless people?
  - They don't deserve it
  - They are lazy
  - Teaching a man to fish is more sustainable than giving him fish

- What have charities done wrong?
  - x

- Why do charities exist?
  - x

- Is helping the homeless out of pity or selfishness more harmful long-term than helpful?
  - That is, does someone helping out of pity propogate or reinforce the idea that we should help out of pity or charity, and does that outcome hinder progress so much that not donating out of pity would save us from social harm? 

- Tools (i.e. my web app) and bias/ideas:
  - Can tools carry ideas?
  - Can tools spread ideas?
  - Twitter being used for activism
  - Twitter being used by nazis/hate groups
  - Should the creator intervene?

- Should I ever disallow a group from using my tool if I deem they're mis-using it?
  - What is misuse?
  - Should I change the license?
  - Who am I to dictate who is 'allowed' to use my app?
  - Do groups who force religion on homeless people get to use my app?
  - Do groups who sell the donated items and take a cut not get to use my app?
    - What's the threshhold?
