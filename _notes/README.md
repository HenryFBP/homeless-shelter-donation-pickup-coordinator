# In general
I will choose shelters to interview based off of:

- Rating
  - Yelp
  - Google Maps Reviews
- Likelihood of:
  - Responding to my queries
  - Giving feedback, telling me what **they need** from me in terms of app dev
  - Co-operating in my app dev quest

Once (if) the app is finished, I will simply reach out to as many shelters as
possible and, as this app is free to use and distribute, offer them the usage of
the app.

There will be a Wiki that will tell both users and orgs how to use my
application, register themselves, put their stuff up, etc.

### Notes from 03/14/2018 discussion

- Talked mainly about small yet important things that the app should do
  - Bookkeeping!
    - Export transaction logs as `csv`, `pdf`, `docx`, `txt`, etc
    - Sign-up form for users that Orgs can customize
    - Keep track of items that an Org has
  - Inter-organization transfers
  - Donators must let Orgs know EXACTLY what they're donating
    - i.e. men's underwear is essentially useless to Sarah's circle
- Other Orgs I should contact are:
  - [Sarah's Circle (♀)](#sarahs-circle-)
  - Night Ministry
