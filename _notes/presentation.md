# Presentation

Hello everyone.

I'm Henry Post.

My interactive media project for this class is a web application designed to make it easier for civilians to donate
goods to homeless shelters.

The application is open-source, and has its code available at a public repository on a site called 'GitHub'.

After about two weeks since its conception, it was launched as a live web app and can be accessed at
[https://shelter-pickup-coordinator.herokuapp.com](https://shelter-pickup-coordinator.herokuapp.com).

Feel free to try it out for yourself if you have a laptop! There are some example credentials available on the homepage.

Currently, you can:

- Create an account,
- Create a list of items and a home, complete with Geolocation features,
- Create an Organization page,
- Create a list of prioritized items as an Org,
- Search for other Donator's Homes, sorted by distance.

It is unfinished currently, but I plan to continue development throughout my life and hopefully will one day see it in
use by homeless shelters as a fully-functional web application.

I have also contacted several homeless shelters, such as Lincoln Park Community Services and North Side Housing and 
Supportive Services for their thoughts on what this application should do, and what it shouldn't.

The basic idea behind this application is that if donating could be made low-or-no-effort, more people would donate.
As a user, you're meant to make a 'Home' on the application that has an address, and then enter a list of items that you
wish to donate to homeless shelters.

The big thing here is that you, as a donator, are not meant to walk or drive to the shelter, but rather, Organizations
will be able to sort through lists of donators and dispatch pickup vehicles so that they can pick as many goods as
possible. This benefits both shelters and donators, as it allows shelters to reach donators that would otherwise never 
donate because the current methods of donating are too costly with respect to time or effort.

It can also delegate some work from humans to machines with respect to bookkeeping, telling donators the policies about
accepting certain items, and perhaps organization for the shelters.

Development has been relatively slow as I am only one person, and am a student, but for a couple weeks, I've seen lots 
of progress and hope that this project, as an open-source piece of software, will find support from communities or 
developers who wish to use this kind of tool.

Even if this application becomes abandoned, I feel it is still useful as its code is public domain and it could be
adopted by any group who wishes to use it.

If you like to code, design sites, or enjoy Python and want a programming problem to 'chew on' over the summer,
consider making a 'fork' of my project on GitHub and see what you can do to help this application.

Thank you,
