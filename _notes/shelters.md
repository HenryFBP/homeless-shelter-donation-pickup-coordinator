# In general
I will choose shelters to interview based off of:

- Rating
  - Yelp
  - Google Maps Reviews
- Likelihood of:
  - Responding to my queries
  - Giving feedback, telling me what **they need** from me in terms of app dev
  - Co-operating in my app dev quest

Once (if) the app is finished, I will simply reach out to as many shelters as
possible and, as this app is free to use and distribute, offer them the usage of
the app.
